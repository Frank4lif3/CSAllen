1. Create a file named "main.swift".
2. Use your code from project 2511 as a starting point.
3. Refactor the code using a Dictionary which maps the predecessor of a rule to the rule itself.
4. Read from standard input.  Expect the following:
   - The alphabet of an LSystem prefixed by the string "alphabet:" followed by the alphabet.
   - A series of one or more production rules, one per line, preceded by the string "productionRule:".
     Each rule will indicate the predecessor, the string " -> ", followed by the successor.
   - The axiom, preceded by the string "axiom:".
   - The generationCount to be produced, preceded by the string "generationCount:".
5. Produce the following output:
   - The string "terminals:" followed by a list of terminals, in sorted order.
   - The string "nonTerminals:" followed by a list of nonterminals, in sorted order.
   - For the number of generations requested, print each generation on its own line,
     preceded by the string "generation[n]:" where n is the index of the generation
     being printed.
