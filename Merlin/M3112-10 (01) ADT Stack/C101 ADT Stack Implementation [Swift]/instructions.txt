1.  Create a file named "main.swift"
2.  Create a STRUCT or CLASS implementing the Stack ADT which must hold up to 100 Integers
    * REQUIREMENTS:  DO NOT USE .append(), .remove(), popLast(), etc.
    		     You must keep track of an index that points to the top of the stack
3.  Read from standard input until EOF
4.  Process the following commands, one per line:
    PUSH <integer>
    	pushes the specified integer onto the stack
    POP
	pops the integer at the top of the stack
	prints the integer
    PEEK
	prints the integer at the top of the stack
    ISEMPTY
	prints "true" iff the stack is empty, otherwise false
    DUMP
	prints every integer in the stack, delimited by spaces,
	_without_ altering the stack
