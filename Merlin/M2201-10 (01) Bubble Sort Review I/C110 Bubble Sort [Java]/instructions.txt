1.  Edit the file named "BubbleSort.java"
2.  Within this file, write a program which will sort the array of integers
    using Bubble Sort.
3.  The output should be as follows:
    Pass: <p>, Swaps: <pass swap count>/<total swap count>, Array: [<comma-delimitted array contents>]
    For example:
        Pass: 0, Swaps: 0/0, Array: [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
    	Pass: 1, Swaps: 3/3, Array: [1, 4, 2, 5, 8]
