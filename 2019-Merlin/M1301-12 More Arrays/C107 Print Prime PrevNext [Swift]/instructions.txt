 1.  Edit a file named "main.swift"
 2.  Write a new function named "adjacentPrimes" which accepts a single parameter named "integers"

     of type array of integer.

     On separate rows,  print a comma-delmited pair of numbers for each integer in the array,

     where the first number of the pair is the largest prime number found which is less than the

     array element, and the second number of the pair is the smallest prime number which is greater

     than the array element.


     Elements in the array will be greater than or equal to three.
