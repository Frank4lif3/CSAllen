 1.  Edit a file named "main.swift"
 2.  Write a new function named "printIntegersAndIndex" which:

         - accepts a single parameter name "integers" of type array of integers

     	 - returns the number of elements in the array

	 - in array order, prints each index surrounded by brackets, an arrow (->), the element,

	   and then " is odd" iff the element is odd, otherwise " is even"

	   Each element should be on a separate line.
