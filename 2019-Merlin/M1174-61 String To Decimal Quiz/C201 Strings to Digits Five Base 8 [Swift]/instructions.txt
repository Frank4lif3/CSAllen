 1.  Edit a file named "main.swift"
 2.  Without using an explicit conversion from a String to an Integer,
     convert the specified string 'string' to a base ten integer, ignoring any
     characters which are non-digits.
 *   Digits for bases larger than 10 will use lowercase letters.
 3.  Be sure to use the source base specified in the name of the challenge.
 *   The base will also be specified as a constant.
 4.  Divide the result (using integer division) by the integer 'm'.
 5.  Print the original string on the first line.
 6.  Print the result of the calculation on the second line.
