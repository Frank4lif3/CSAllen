 1.  Edit a file named "main.swift"
 2.  Write a new function named "gcd" which accepts two Integer parameters (p and q) and returns

     the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.


     Both p and q will be positive integers.


     You may wish to make use of "Euclid's Algorithm" which states that:

     If p > q, the gcd of p and q is the same as the gcd of q and p % q.
