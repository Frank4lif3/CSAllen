1. Edit a file named "main.swift"
2. Implement a function named 'numberAsWord' which takes a single,
   Int parameter named 'number' and returns a String.
   The function should return a String which uses words to
   describe the integer.
   For example, given the integer 5, the String returned
   should be "five".
*  Note the name of the challenge which may indicate relevant
   constraints.
