 1.  Edit a file named "main.swift"
 2.  Write a new function named "hollers" which accepts two String parameters
     and an Integer parameter.
     The first parameter is named "from" and the second is named "to".
     The third parameter is named "repeated".
     The function returns an integer which describes the total number of
     characters contained in the printed string and produces as a side effect the printing of
     the name specified in "from", then " hollers ", then the name specified in "to"
     repeated "repeated" times, separated by commas and a space.
     After each "to" name, exclamation points are used consistent with the number
     of times the name is specified up to that point.
 3.  Write a second function named hollersAndPrintCount which takes the same parameters
     as the previous function, invokes the previous function, and then prints the
     return value of that function.
